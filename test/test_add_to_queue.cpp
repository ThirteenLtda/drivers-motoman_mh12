/**
 * Given the documentation:
 * In the case of motion message that adds a trajectory point used to generate incremental
 * motion in the queue, if the queue is full the reply could be delayed. This is undesirable
 * because it would prevent other message such as stop motion to come in. So in order to
 * prevent this situation, the message is parsed and its data validated, the point data is then
 * temporarily copied to be processed by the AddToIncQueueProcess background task. So a
 * success reply on such instruction only indicates that the message was accepted and not that
 * the motion was completely processed into incremental moves. If the background task is
 * already processing a point, a busy reply will be return to the client and the client will have to
 * resend the message again.
 * 
 * Add to Inc Move Queue Task
 * 
 * The AddToIncQueueProcess task (figure 6) is a background tasks that take a motion 
 * messageâ€™s trajectory data and breaks it down to incremental motion segments that matches
 * the controller interpolation period. In the case of multiple motion server connections, you
 * would have one AddToIncMoveQueue task for each motion server task.
